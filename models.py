"""Pydantic models for Oversee's request and response shapes.

Kept deliberately thin. The OTEL ingest payload is parsed with manual dict
walking in main.py rather than modeled here, because the OTLP/JSON wire format
is loose (mixed value types, optional fields) and a strict Pydantic model
would reject valid traffic from real-world agent SDKs.
